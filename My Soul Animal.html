 <h1> <B> MY SOUL ANIMAL </B> </h1>
 <p>
  <i>My Soul Animal</i> is a <b>Dolphin</b>. Because I feel that dolphins are friendly animals and they love water so as I .<br />
    So i choose my soul animal as dolphin . So when I see dolphin I go into my own world . Dolphins travel/swim in groups , they hepl each other
    every tough situations and i feel that if consider someone aas my friend with true feelings i will help them in every situation . They swim in 
    large seas and oceans where we can see diffrent types of aquatic animals , plants and rocks of diffent shapes which are very beautiful and 
    mesmorising . I never saw dolphins in person but i watch them in animal planet , discovery channels etc. they attracted me a lot . 
     I Love Dolphins .
